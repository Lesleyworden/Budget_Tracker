## Adding Data

When a user navigates to box labeled "Name of transaction" they put in a brief description of what the item they are adding or subtracting to the budget. 

Once they have named the transaction they then move to the next box and insert the amount of the transaction.

Next, the user clicks on either "add funds" or "subtract funds" depending on the transaction they made.

This will add the transaction to the ledger and start creating a data chart to help show spending habits.
